Project Background:

A substantial number of hotel reservations are lost due to cancellations or no-shows. The most common reasons include unexpected sickness, accidents, schedule difficulties, unexpected obligations, and natural disasters. Although the ability to cancel a hotel reservation (ideally at a low cost) is advantageous to prospective hotel guests, it is less desired and revenue-diminishing element for hotel managers to cope with. Such losses are particularly high on last-minute cancellations. However, new technologies involving online booking channels have dramatically changed customers’ booking possibilities and behavior. This increases the problem of how hotels manage cancellations, which no longer restricted to traditional booking and passenger characteristics, resulting in missed opportunities for revenue optimization and operational efficiencies. (Falk & Vieru, 2018).

Problem Statement & Objectives:

Lack of accurate cancellation prediction hinders effective decision-making regarding pricing, inventory management, staffing and personalized guests’ services. To address these challenges, our aim is to leverage machine learning algorithms and historical Hotel Reservation Dataset to build a reliable predictive model for hotel reservation cancellations. The model will make use of relevant data and trends to assess the likelihood of cancellation for each reservation, providing real-time insights and recommendations to revenue managers, front-desk workers, and decision-makers.
The study's objective is to minimize monetary losses, identification of high-risk reservations, enhance customer retention initiatives and flexible booking opportunities to provide superior customer experience which will be a win-win situation for both customers and hotel management.

Conclusion:

The Random Forest classifier outperformed the other models and achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 89.5% with a Kappa value of 75.8% in predicting booking status. This implies that it is highly effective at differentiating between customers who are likely to cancel bookings and those who are not. The model's accuracy makes it a dependable tool for data-driven decision-making in marketing.
Based on the model's output, effective marketing activities on customers who are predicted to cancel bookings could result in a substantial 65% return on investment (ROI) on marketing expenditure, demonstrating the effectiveness of marketing strategies in retaining a significant portion of potentially lost business.
Although the model's accuracy and return on investment are impressive, it is crucial to consistently monitor its performance and adapt marketing strategies accordingly. Keeping the model up to date with new data will ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness. By incorporating these insights into marketing strategies, hotels can optimize its marketing efforts, improve customer retention rates, and ultimately increase overall profitability.
